      <h1>Pitching</h1>
<p>Pitching is related to <a href="/storytelling.html">storytelling</a>. It's best to
start there and craft a compelling story. Then distill that story into a
clear, concise pitch that captures the most important elements.</p>
<h2>Constructing the pitch</h2>
<p>If raising capital is necessary for your company then pitching to venture 
capitalists will be important. The following resources provide recommendations
for storytelling, simplification and inspiration.</p>
<h3><a href="http://avc.com/2010/06/six-slides/">Six Slides</a></h3>
<p>Fred Wilson's strong recommendation is to construct a pitch deck with only 
six slides. </p>
<ol>
<li>Simplify your company's story into six killer slides</li>
<li>Shorten the pitch deck so it leaves time for conversation</li>
<li>Inspire investors so they ask follow up questions where you dive into
     further details</li>
</ol>
<h3><a href="http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2011/09/what-story-are-you-trying-to-tell-to-potential-investors.html">What story are you trying to tell to potential investors?</a></h3>
<p>Gabriel Weinberg specifies four topics you must nail in a pitch deck.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2013/04/when-im-thinking-about-investing.html">Constructing a better startup pitch</a></h3>
<p>Venture capitalists will ask these big "why" questions when deciding whether 
or not to invest in your company. It's important to answer those questions 
during your pitch.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3007530/open-company/how-pitch-your-tech-project-us-and-everyone-else">How To Pitch Your Tech Project To Us</a></h3>
<p>provides insight from a journalist about what is and is not successful
  with startup pitches.</p>
<ol>
<li>Be genuine by telling your own unique story</li>
<li>Have the story "go behind the curtain" and show what really goes on
     instead of trying to present a perfect squeeky clean image</li>
<li>The story should end with a "pot of gold" - a new algorithm, way of 
     thinking or novel insight</li>
</ol>
<h3><a href="http://www.quora.com/Brendan-Baker/Posts/Startups-How-to-Storyboard-your-Pitch-Deck-in-10-Steps">How to Storyboard your Pitch Deck in 10 Steps</a></h3>
<p>This ten step guide walks through exactly how to create a great deck
from start to pitch.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/2013/7/18/the-hook-the-most-important-part-of-a-pitch.html">The Hook: The most important part of a pitch</a></h3>
<p>An opinionated but valuable perspective that hooking the audience with a 
clear differentiated hook is the best way to start a pitch.</p>
<h2>Improving your pitch</h2>
<p>The job is not done once you have the pitch deck created. Pitch, get feedback,
tweak and iterate.</p>
<h3><a href="http://nibletz.com/2013/07/16/3-ways-improve-startups-pitch-deck/">3 Ways to Improve Your Pitch Deck</a></h3>
<p>This article argues that every pitch deck should at least answer these three
questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does it look like your customer base is growing? Visually prove you are
     growing.</li>
<li>Do your customers like your product? Acquiring new customers is more
     expensive than having existing customers stay customers.</li>
<li>Does it look like your business/product can actually scale? VCs want
     to invest in businesses that grow to $100M+ within five years.</li>
</ol>
