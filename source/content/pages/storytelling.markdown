# Storytelling
Telling a great story about your company makes it memorable and humanizing.
These storytelling posts will help you figure out what that story's content
should be. Eventually you can distill the story into a shorter but still
powerful form to tell it as a [pitch](/pitching.html).


## Why stories are critical to startups
There's always a new exciting company on the horizon. The ones that stick in
our minds though are those with a great product and a unique hook for how they
got to be where they are. 

It's not enough in today's world of constant 
distractions to "want to change the world." That phrase is now so cliche it'll
make people ignore you. Instead, tell a fresh, compelling, but realistic story 
about your company.

disparate facts.

Tell the story of the founders but make sure it is not boring. There need to
be interesting quirks or else every story will sound like "20 something white
males sick of corporate jobs move to Silicon Valley and started this company."

There are an infinite number of novel techniques to make the story unique and 
interesting to a wide audience. Use those techniques. However, note that 
storytelling is no substitute for a clear business strategy.
