# Storytelling
Telling a great story about your company makes it memorable and humanizing.
These storytelling posts will help you figure out what that story's content
should be. Eventually you can distill the story into a shorter but still
powerful form to tell it as a [pitch](/pitching.html).

## Ideas for your story
Coming up with the initial story ideas can be difficult. The following posts
will help you get over that first hurdle.

Tell the story of the founders but make sure it is not boring. There need to
be interesting quirks or else every story will sound like "20 something white

There are an infinite number of novel techniques to make the story unique and 
interesting to a wide audience. Use those techniques. However, note that 
storytelling is no substitute for a clear business strategy.
