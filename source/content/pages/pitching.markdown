# Pitching
Pitching is related to [storytelling](/storytelling.html). It's best to
start there and craft a compelling story. Then distill that story into a
clear, concise pitch that captures the most important elements.

## Constructing the pitch
If raising capital is necessary for your company then pitching to venture 
capitalists will be important. The following resources provide recommendations
for storytelling, simplification and inspiration.


### [Six Slides](http://avc.com/2010/06/six-slides/) 
Fred Wilson's strong recommendation is to construct a pitch deck with only 
six slides. 

  1. Simplify your company's story into six killer slides
  1. Shorten the pitch deck so it leaves time for conversation
  1. Inspire investors so they ask follow up questions where you dive into
     further details

during your pitch.

  provides insight from a journalist about what is and is not successful
  with startup pitches.

  1. Be genuine by telling your own unique story
  1. Have the story "go behind the curtain" and show what really goes on
     instead of trying to present a perfect squeeky clean image
  1. The story should end with a "pot of gold" - a new algorithm, way of 
     thinking or novel insight

## Improving your pitch
The job is not done once you have the pitch deck created. Pitch, get feedback,
tweak and iterate.

### [3 Ways to Improve Your Pitch Deck](http://nibletz.com/2013/07/16/3-ways-improve-startups-pitch-deck/)
This article argues that every pitch deck should at least answer these three
questions:

  1. Does it look like your customer base is growing? Visually prove you are
     growing.
  1. Do your customers like your product? Acquiring new customers is more
     expensive than having existing customers stay customers.
  1. Does it look like your business/product can actually scale? VCs want
     to invest in businesses that grow to $100M+ within five years.
